## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
This project is a REST API service that models a simple marina with three resources: users, boats, and loads. These resources can be manipulated through various CRUD operations. It is written in JavaScript and HTML using NodeJS and Express. It is deployed through Google App Engine with Google Datastore as the NoSQL database and uses Oktaâ€™s Auth0 for user authentication.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Here are the links required to use this cloud API:
- API URL: [https://kp-marina-api.uw.r.appspot.com](https://kp-marina-api.uw.r.appspot.com "API URL")
- Account creation and login: [https://kp-marina-api.uw.r.appspot.com](https://kp-marina-api.uw.r.appspot.com "Account creation and login")

While many resources and features are publicly available (more on this in the sections below), an account is needed to fully utilize the API. To create an account:
1. Go to the [account creation and login page](https://kp-marina-api.uw.r.appspot.com "Account creation and login").
2. Click on the _Login/Create Account_ button.
3. Click _Sign Up_ on the Auth0 page.
4. Create the account using an email and a password.
5. Save the JSON Web Token (JWT) displayed on the landing page. This will be needed when making certain requests to the API. It can also be accessed again by logging in any time.
